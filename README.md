Tune Tangle by Alex Nunan

This trivia app is designed to test a user's song knowledge. A user selects a playlist from their Spotify account, and a random song is picked from that playlist. The user must guess the title of the random song using feedback after each guess, pulled from Spotify's open API.

App Instructions:

1. Visit: tune-tangle.herokuapp.com
2. Sign in to Spotify and accept data sharing permissions.
3. Choose one of your playlists from the list pulled from Spotify.
4. Make a guess at a song by entering in the search bar.
5. Analyze the feedback to refine your next guesses.
6. After 10 tries, or after guessing the correct song, choose a new playlist to play again.


To Do:

 - Include an Mp3 play bar for the random song, providing 5 more seconds of the song after each guess.
 - Continue styling
 - Add stock playlists for users to guess at unfamiliar playlists eg. 1000 Greatest Rock Songs
